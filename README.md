# WELCOME TO APPLES 2 APPLES!

To run the code, simply run the .bat or .sh, depending on your os, to compile the programm.

Then, go to the bin folder, then launch a server using:
```java
java StartServer [NbOfPlayers] [NbOfHumanPlayers]
```
Then launch as many clients as you have chosen human players, using 
```java
java StartClient
```

To run the tests, simply run the runtest.bat  in the main folder.

(They sometime freeze on my computer, but crtl + c and lauching them again works :( )

To help you understand the code, you can go in the javadoc folder, here you will find documentation for the project,
as well as the diagramm of the classes.
Also,  there are some comments inside the code as well, to help understand as you code.
